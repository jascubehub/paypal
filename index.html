<p>Do you really catch more flies with honey than with vinegar? Do an experiment to find out! Watch the video above to learn how to make a simple homemade fly trap using a plastic bottle. Then, experiment to discover which bait attracts the most flies. You can try a variety of liquids, and you can also use solid bait like rotting food or meat, but you will need to add some water so the flies drown. A drop of soap can help break the surface tension of the water, making it easier for the flies to drown. However, it may also alter the smell of the food, so that is a variable you should consider.
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not perform this project in a location where you risk catching beneficial insects like bees!</p>
